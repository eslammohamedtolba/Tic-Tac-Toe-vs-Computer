# Tic-tac-toe, also known as X-O Game, is a two-player game played on a n*n grid. 
# The game is played by two players who take turns marking the spaces in the grid with X or O. 
# The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
# If all n*n squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is considered a draw.
