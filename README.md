# Tic-Tac-Toe-vs-Computer
The game is played by two players who take turns marking the spaces in the grid with X or O. 
The player who succeeds in placing n(size of the grid) of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
If all n*n squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is considered a tie
